I’ve been a cricket fan my entire life and we’ve literally not won any ICC tournaments since I was 6. I am so proud of the effort we’ve shown for such a tiny little nation and how far we’ve come from the dark days of the 2000s.\n",
      "- How fitting that it was two of New Zealand's all-time most prolific batsmen. Congrats Kiwi's. You guys showed how test cricket is meant to be played. Well deserved\n",
      "- The fact that it was Rosco and Kanos. Happiest I’ve ever been after a sports event\n",
      "- Deserved for NZ, so happy for you. \n",

      "- What a performance from Kanos and Taylor. Incredible knock from both\n",
      "- NZC please for gods sake give this team 10 times more Tests; 2-Test series are a *crime* for this team.\n",

As a Saffa, this is the best possible result. As we like to say, anyone but England and Australia (and India). Well played gents, enjoy the lagers.\n",
      "- I thought that as an Indian it would hurt to lose the final. But if it really would have been any team, I personally would have definitely wanted it to be NZ.

      "- I was expecting a draw, and would have been happy enough with a draw, given the circumstances and the shootout nature of a one-off Test. India were magnificent considering they had no proper warmup and both the toss & conditions were more in favour of NZ. But man, that exorcised some demons. And seeing those warm hugs at the end between Ross & Kane, then Kane and Kohli, I couldn't help but choke up a bit. Feels good man.\n",
      "- It’s poetic how today summed New Zealand’s team performance today. Shami swung wildly at a Southee ball and got 4 runs off the edge, the very next ball Kano placed Latham at a “Fly Slip” (am I saying it correct?), and f***ing hell the VERY next ball Shami again had a whack but edged it to Latham who moved only once! It’s crazy how precise, methodological and a team NZ looks. Absolutely incredible.\n",

      "- No words. Never been more proud of this team and this country.\n",
      "- I'm very happy we won, but I'm more hapy for Rosco and BJ. It's so fitting Rosco was there hitting the wining runs. It still hurts knwoing how he was treated and how the captaincy was taken from him. Legend of NZ Cricket.\n",

      "- I've had an awful day. This helped a lot :)\n",
      "- This feels genuinely surreal. Cricket was what really united my dad and I, and gave us a super close bond. He passed away in 2017 having seen NZ come bitterly close to getting our first major gong (excluding CT) in 2015, yet he always insisted test cricket was the pinnacle. I'm sure he's over the moon up there right now that we've reached the true pinnacle.\n",
      "- I loved how Simon Doull said “ sometimes good guys finish first”.\n",

      "Back when I was 10 or so, cricket was completely my world. Being an introvert and definitely not finding anyone interested in simulating 5-day matches with me, I began shadow batting and simulating hitting the ball against my living room wall. Without Internet those days, my sources were the daily newspapers for scorecards. At that time; the only series that was ongoing was an obscure NZ SL in mid 90s. I faithfully copied out the player names, made my teams and excitedly created my first match scorecard. In my “simulated” match, I pretended to play as NZ and one of my batters got a double ton. The real match had not yet started at this time, btw. The player who got the ton? Bryan Young. And imagine my exhilaration when the real Young actually scored a double ton (and vanished soon after) but I remember him so vividly because in a way I relived his ton. I haven’t shared this with anyone because it was my silly childhood indulgence that mostly no one would appreciate (though dad was because he used to sneak up and look into ny scorebooks :))\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m sharing it now because that started my journey with a lifelong fascination with the Kiwi team. In every simulation game, I would start off playing as them (even though I’m an Indian and get crushed whenever the Indian team loses). I kept rooting for them in every major ICC tournament, fascinated with how they kept punching  above the weight but somehow not able to make it past the finishing line. I also absolutely loved the vibes at their grounds - the carnival, relaxed crowd, conditions so different from India, and the lack of successes we had touring there. I was absolutely gutted with how it turned out for them in 2015 and 2019 wc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So when I say that I didn’t mind us losing, I’m not saying that just to console myself or appear condescending but I truly felt happy (after the crushing disappointment of my hopes for an unlikely win gone) that after some 25 years from when my fascination started with this team and when they became my 2nd favourite team, it gladdens me to see them earn this absolutely well deserved honour. Congrats to all the fans!\n",

I’m so happy Kane, Ross, Trent and Tim have immortalised their careers claiming the No.1 test ranking and capping it off with a world championship in the pinnacle of our game.  This also I feel doesn’t happen without Bmac instilling a culture change when he was captain.  A piece of this win belongs to him too\n",

      "So happy\n",
      "- To say New Zealand thoroughly deserved is an understatement. As an Indian, if I were to pick top 10 players from the match it would be 9 kiwis with shami somewhere in there.

We have always been told that tests with NZ dont make them enough money and that they dont want to do 5 match series with us.

They've got a great bowling department, strong batting and a proper team ethos.  Today underlined why they are a good team, the game could have peetered out into a draw, but they bowled well this morning and then hung in there with the bat against some tricky bowling and got over the line with a few overs left. An 8 wicket win looks like a comfortable victory but it was much tighter in reality. \n",

      "I was a bit cynical about the concept of the WTC when it was first mooted  - I thought that a team might just get lucky and win a few matches and sneak through to the final without really deserving it.

      "- Thoroughly deserved victory for the Kiwis. Even though it was a different format, says a lot about their mental fortitude and self belief to pull themselves up and win after some heartbreaking defeats. Some of their players did talk about being disheartened and their victory today has an important lesson, which is that recovery from a position of despair is often not instantaneous but a process that needs to be respected. Despite not having the hype of some other teams, over the last two years, all players from this team have stuck to their guns and contributed here and there for the results. Well done!\n",

      "- Despite a lot of issue with the league stage of the WTC (which won't be easily solved), I can  say that as a cricket nut, this right here is the final that matters the most. The 2019 WC final was more dramatic, but this was unmatched in pure cricket quality. I can't get over the fact that everyone wrote a result off, but then NZ took 8 wickets and chased a decent total, all in the reserve day. Win by 8 wickets might not be the barest of margins, but in terms of time it absolutely was - the last hour in a SIX day game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of the teams played really fucking well, I know a lot of Indians fans were disgruntled with their 2nd innings batting, but holy shit, NZ were absolutely relentless and most teams would've folded. In fact, India batted brilliantly in the first innings until a jaffa from Jamieson got Kohli, which for me, was the turning moment. Anyway, can't wait for more WTC finals. I hope we get a SENA nations showdown in the subcontinent to see who's worse at playing spin, lol.\n",

I feel extremely proud of Indian team and the performance, keep your head high guys. And for New Zealand, Kane Williamson and Kyle Jamieson, you won billion hearts. Takes a lot of courage and grit to finally get an ICC trophy after 2015 and 2019. One of the best moment for international test  cricket. Thanks India and New Zealand!\n",

I’m disappointed, as an India supporter but everyone loses and if I had to pick to lose to anyone, it would have been NZ. If I had those two defeats happen to me, I could not have accepted the defeat with the humility and grace that NZ showed. That’s a champions mentality they show then and they were better in these conditions than India and they’ve come a long way with batting. They were always close to number one in bowling and fielding in my eyes. I’m happy they have some deserved reward for playing so well but also filled with sadness at how Rohit Sharma turned the tide away from us yesterday evening and the team didn’t show backbone to defy NZ.\n",

We had small dashes of glory, but we'd always lose and losing two WC finals in a row, the second one when it was only an umpiring mistake that even put us in a position to lose, just felt absolutely cruel- like at any moment NZ could go back to being bad again and we might never win at all.\n",

      "\n",
      "Back when I was 10 or so, cricket was completely my world. Being an introvert and definitely not finding anyone interested in simulating 5-day matches with me, I began shadow batting and simulating hitting the ball against my living room wall. Without Internet those days, my sources were the daily newspapers for scorecards. At that time; the only series that was ongoing was an obscure NZ SL in mid 90s. I faithfully copied out the player names, made my teams and excitedly created my first match scorecard. In my “simulated” match, I pretended to play as NZ and one of my batters got a double ton. The real match had not yet started at this time, btw. The player who got the ton? Bryan Young. And imagine my exhilaration when the real Young actually scored a double ton (and vanished soon after) but I remember him so vividly because in a way I relived his ton. I haven’t shared this with anyone because it was my silly childhood indulgence that mostly no one would appreciate (though dad was because he used to sneak up and look into ny scorebooks :))\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m sharing it now because that started my journey with a lifelong fascination with the Kiwi team. In every simulation game, I would start off playing as them (even though I’m an Indian and get crushed whenever the Indian team loses). I kept rooting for them in every major ICC tournament, fascinated with how they kept punching  above the weight but somehow not able to make it past the finishing line. I also absolutely loved the vibes at their grounds - the carnival, relaxed crowd, conditions so different from India, and the lack of successes we had touring there. I was absolutely gutted with how it turned out for them in 2015 and 2019 wc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So when I say that I didn’t mind us losing, I’m not saying that just to console myself or appear condescending but I truly felt happy (after the crushing disappointment of my hopes for an unlikely win gone) that after some 25 years from when my fascination started with this team and when they became my 2nd favourite team, it gladdens me to see them earn this absolutely well deserved honour. Congrats to all the fans!\n",

      "- I actually cried when we won.  Being a NZ cricket fan all my life, so many disappointments.  I’m so happy Kane, Ross, Trent and Tim have immortalised their careers claiming the No.1 test ranking and capping it off with a world championship in the pinnacle of our game.  This also I feel doesn’t happen without Bmac instilling a culture change when he was captain.  A piece of this win belongs to him too\n",

      "So happy\n",
      "- To say New Zealand thoroughly deserved is an understatement. As an Indian, if I were to pick top 10 players from the match it would be 9 kiwis with shami somewhere in there.

We have always been told that tests with NZ dont make them enough money and that they dont want to do 5 match series with us. It takes 9 years or whatever for us to even be able to have a series with Aus who are our next door neighbours so for me, you cant have it both ways.\n",

They've got a great bowling department, strong batting and a proper team ethos.  Today underlined why they are a good team, the game could have peetered out into a draw, but they bowled well this morning and then hung in there with the bat against some tricky bowling and got over the line with a few overs left. An 8 wicket win looks like a comfortable victory but it was much tighter in reality. \n",

Even though it was a different format, says a lot about their mental fortitude and self belief to pull themselves up and win after some heartbreaking defeats. Some of their players did talk about being disheartened and their victory today has an important lesson, which is that recovery from a position of despair is often not instantaneous but a process that needs to be respected. Despite not having the hype of some other teams, over the last two years, all players from this team have stuck to their guns and contributed here and there for the results. Well done!\n",

The 2019 WC final was more dramatic, but this was unmatched in pure cricket quality. I can't get over the fact that everyone wrote a result off, but then NZ took 8 wickets and chased a decent total, all in the reserve day. Win by 8 wickets might not be the barest of margins, but in terms of time it absolutely was - the last hour in a SIX day game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of the teams played really fucking well, I know a lot of Indians fans were disgruntled with their 2nd innings batting, but holy shit, NZ were absolutely relentless and most teams would've folded. In fact, India batted brilliantly in the first innings until a jaffa from Jamieson got Kohli, which for me, was the turning moment. Anyway, can't wait for more WTC finals.

I’m disappointed, as an India supporter but everyone loses and if I had to pick to lose to anyone, it would have been NZ. If I had those two defeats happen to me, I could not have accepted the defeat with the humility and grace that NZ showed. That’s a champions mentality they show then and they were better in these conditions than India and they’ve come a long way with batting. They were always close to number one in bowling and fielding in my eyes. I’m happy they have some deserved reward for playing so well but also filled with sadness at how Rohit Sharma turned the tide away from us yesterday evening and the team didn’t show backbone to defy NZ.\n",

      "\n",
      "Back when I was 10 or so, cricket was completely my world. Being an introvert and definitely not finding anyone interested in simulating 5-day matches with me, I began shadow batting and simulating hitting the ball against my living room wall. Without Internet those days, my sources were the daily newspapers for scorecards. At that time; the only series that was ongoing was an obscure NZ SL in mid 90s. I faithfully copied out the player names, made my teams and excitedly created my first match scorecard. In my “simulated” match, I pretended to play as NZ and one of my batters got a double ton. The real match had not yet started at this time, btw. The player who got the ton? Bryan Young. And imagine my exhilaration when the real Young actually scored a double ton (and vanished soon after) but I remember him so vividly because in a way I relived his ton. I haven’t shared this with anyone because it was my silly childhood indulgence that mostly no one would appreciate (though dad was because he used to sneak up and look into ny scorebooks :))\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m sharing it now because that started my journey with a lifelong fascination with the Kiwi team. In every simulation game, I would start off playing as them (even though I’m an Indian and get crushed whenever the Indian team loses). I kept rooting for them in every major ICC tournament, fascinated with how they kept punching  above the weight but somehow not able to make it past the finishing line. I also absolutely loved the vibes at their grounds - the carnival, relaxed crowd, conditions so different from India, and the lack of successes we had touring there. I was absolutely gutted with how it turned out for them in 2015 and 2019 wc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So when I say that I didn’t mind us losing, I’m not saying that just to console myself or appear condescending but I truly felt happy (after the crushing disappointment of my hopes for an unlikely win gone) that after some 25 years from when my fascination started with this team and when they became my 2nd favourite team, it gladdens me to see them earn this absolutely well deserved honour. Congrats to all the fans!\n",

      "- I actually cried when we won.  Being a NZ cricket fan all my life, so many disappointments.  I’m so happy Kane, Ross, Trent and Tim have immortalised their careers claiming the No.1 test ranking and capping it off with a world championship in the pinnacle of our game.  This also I feel doesn’t happen without Bmac instilling a culture change when he was captain.  A piece of this win belongs to him too\n",

      "\n",
      "So happy\n",
      "- To say New Zealand thoroughly deserved is an understatement. As an Indian, if I were to pick top 10 players from the match it would be 9 kiwis with shami somewhere in there.

      "We would love to play more tests against Eng/India/Aus and 5 tests series but the reality is that none of them want to. We have always been told that tests with NZ dont make them enough money and that they dont want to do 5 match series with us. It takes 9 years or whatever for us to even be able to have a series with Aus who are our next door neighbours so for me, you cant have it both ways.\n",

They've got a great bowling department, strong batting and a proper team ethos.  Today underlined why they are a good team, the game could have peetered out into a draw, but they bowled well this morning and then hung in there with the bat against some tricky bowling and got over the line with a few overs left. An 8 wicket win looks like a comfortable victory but it was much tighter in reality. \n",

Even though it was a different format, says a lot about their mental fortitude and self belief to pull themselves up and win after some heartbreaking defeats. Some of their players did talk about being disheartened and their victory today has an important lesson, which is that recovery from a position of despair is often not instantaneous but a process that needs to be respected. Despite not having the hype of some other teams, over the last two years, all players from this team have stuck to their guns and contributed here and there for the results. Well done!\n",

      "- As a kiwi cricket fan of a certain vintage, it still takes a moment to register moments like this. The last 6 years of sustained excellence is still not erasing the 25 years before it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is a seriously good team playing seriously good cricket in all forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Congratulations to the side for achieving something pretty amazing. And in such emphatic fashion as well\n",
      "- So this is the feeling I’ve been hanging out for since the 1992 World Cup.\n",
      "- Super chuffed. Played Ross as a kid, always laser focused. Super happy for him. \n",
      "\n",
      "NZ has had a litany of journeymen cricketers over the years I’ve been around. It’s so good this team. So much talent. Such a change from players like Hartland, Pocock, David White, Trevor Franklin, Vaughan, Priest, Haslam, De Groen, Wisneski, Millmow, I could go on for hours on the various never quite weres that infested our team in the post Hadlee era.\n",
      "- Any time anyone beats India is a good day. Bunch of absolute flogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact it was our brothers across the ditch makes it even sweeter.\n",
      "- Kanos is the most watchable batsman out of the big 4. He has an air of serene assurance about it. Much like VVS against Australia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kane is like opposite of Smith in terms of watchability.\n",
      "- Congratulations NZ! You deserve it all! So happy NZ finally get to win an ICC championship - and the best of them too!\n",

      "- Extremely happy to see NZ win this title. A squad full of nice and humble guys.\n",
      "- Despite a lot of issue with the league stage of the WTC (which won't be easily solved), I can  say that as a cricket nut, this right here is the final that matters the most. The 2019 WC final was more dramatic, but this was unmatched in pure cricket quality. I can't get over the fact that everyone wrote a result off, but then NZ took 8 wickets and chased a decent total, all in the reserve day. Win by 8 wickets might not be the barest of margins, but in terms of time it absolutely was - the last hour in a SIX day game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of the teams played really fucking well, I know a lot of Indians fans were disgruntled with their 2nd innings batting, but holy shit, NZ were absolutely relentless and most teams would've folded. In fact, India batted brilliantly in the first innings until a jaffa from Jamieson got Kohli, which for me, was the turning moment. Anyway, can't wait for more WTC finals. I hope we get a SENA nations showdown in the subcontinent to see who's worse at playing spin, lol.\n",
      "\n",
      "GG both teams. NZ - all of your players deserve a log cabin pasta.\n",

      "- Thank you Kane, very cool.\n",

      "- NZ IS THE BEST TEAM\n",
      "- As an Indian, I have to congratulate New Zealand for it's humble and nice attitude. New Zealand players are very calm and don't act like jerks. Kane Williamson is a good captain and their bowlers are wonderful. \n",

      "New Zealand is my most favorite cricket team.\n",

      "- I'm an Indian but I'm glad to see that NZ won. They deserved it. Especially after losing the World Cup a few years ago. They have been simply outstanding, and I know Virat and co. acknowledge that (and they shouldn't be too mad about their loss).\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great game of test cricket. Both teams bowled really, really well. India just couldn't figure out their batting.\n",

      "- Deserved win after the WC finals\n",
      "- I can't believe that we have got to this point. After so many years of only sporadic good test performances, and sinking to the low of 45 all out, it is just surreal that we have ended up being the inaugural WTC champions, by beating India in a match outside of NZ.\n",
      "- Persistence! What a show of character by the Kiwis. India, a great team otherwise, was outplayed. No other way to put it. Really happy for the Kiwis.\n",
      "\n",
      "A victory for cricket.\n",
      "- It took 144 years but we finally found out which country is the best at cricket. It was worth the wait.\n",
      "- This will only serve to accelerate our test progression. Imagine now Jamieson can come streaming in with both ball and mace, clanging the batsman over the head.\n",

      "Incredible!🙌\n",
      "- As a die hard Indian cricket fan, I am surprised that I don’t feel bad for the loss or the way India played. I feel extremely proud of Indian team and the performance, keep your head high guys. And for New Zealand, Kane Williamson and Kyle Jamieson, you won billion hearts. Takes a lot of courage and grit to finally get an ICC trophy after 2015 and 2019. One of the best moment for international test  cricket. Thanks India and New Zealand!\n",
      "- Fizzing, we're number one!\n",
      "- Grats NZ, well deserved\n",
      "- NZ deserve ever bit of this success. The heart ache in 2015 in the world cup final with Brendon McCullum and then the 2019 world cup screw over with England. I’m disappointed, as an India supporter but everyone loses and if I had to pick to lose to anyone, it would have been NZ. If I had those two defeats happen to me, I could not have accepted the defeat with the humility and grace that NZ showed. That’s a champions mentality they show then and they were better in these conditions than India and they’ve come a long way with batting. They were always close to number one in bowling and fielding in my eyes. I’m happy they have some deserved reward for playing so well but also filled with sadness at how Rohit Sharma turned the tide away from us yesterday evening and the team didn’t show backbone to defy NZ.\n",

      "- Highest score and best bowling analysis by pretty new players. Second best by veterans. Great mix there that bodes well for the future. Well done Kiwis, that was thoroughly deserved. If it was a seven day test you can imagine Kanos and Taylor still there at the end of tomorrow. Or if it had been India chasing 139 you could picture NZ having a shot at bowling them out. Well done. They’ve certainly got their place in the history books and it would be great to see them go on and win a series in Australia and India at some point.\n",

Whilst being incredibly impressed by their work rate and effort, I didn't quite appreciate just how far it would carry them. That isn't to say that they're a team of plucky hard workers; they're a group of incredibly talented players. I mean to say that those foundations laid by Brendan McCullum and the staff have created a foundation for them to rise a flourish. New Zealand will always be my second team.\n",

      "Back when I was 10 or so, cricket was completely my world. Being an introvert and definitely not finding anyone interested in simulating 5-day matches with me, I began shadow batting and simulating hitting the ball against my living room wall. Without Internet those days, my sources were the daily newspapers for scorecards. At that time; the only series that was ongoing was an obscure NZ SL in mid 90s. I faithfully copied out the player names, made my teams and excitedly created my first match scorecard. In my “simulated” match, I pretended to play as NZ and one of my batters got a double ton. The real match had not yet started at this time, btw. The player who got the ton? Bryan Young. And imagine my exhilaration when the real Young actually scored a double ton (and vanished soon after) but I remember him so vividly because in a way I relived his ton. I haven’t shared this with anyone because it was my silly childhood indulgence that mostly no one would appreciate (though dad was because he used to sneak up and look into ny scorebooks :))\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m sharing it now because that started my journey with a lifelong fascination with the Kiwi team. In every simulation game, I would start off playing as them (even though I’m an Indian and get crushed whenever the Indian team loses). I kept rooting for them in every major ICC tournament, fascinated with how they kept punching  above the weight but somehow not able to make it past the finishing line. I also absolutely loved the vibes at their grounds - the carnival, relaxed crowd, conditions so different from India, and the lack of successes we had touring there. I was absolutely gutted with how it turned out for them in 2015 and 2019 wc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So when I say that I didn’t mind us losing, I’m not saying that just to console myself or appear condescending but I truly felt happy (after the crushing disappointment of my hopes for an unlikely win gone) that after some 25 years from when my fascination started with this team and when they became my 2nd favourite team, it gladdens me to see them earn this absolutely well deserved honour. Congrats to all the fans!\n",

      "- I actually cried when we won.  Being a NZ cricket fan all my life, so many disappointments.  I’m so happy Kane, Ross, Trent and Tim have immortalised their careers claiming the No.1 test ranking and capping it off with a world championship in the pinnacle of our game.  This also I feel doesn’t happen without Bmac instilling a culture change when he was captain.  A piece of this win belongs to him too\n",
      "- Bigger than any of the white ball World Cups IMO and thoroughly deserved. \n",
      "\n",
      "Look at how well resourced Australia, England and India are. NZ have done this on merit and have showed the rest of the cricket world how it should be done. NZ have treated test cricket the way it is meant to be treated, unlike us (England). \n",
      "\n",
      "So happy\n",
      "- To say New Zealand thoroughly deserved is an understatement. As an Indian, if I were to pick top 10 players from the match it would be 9 kiwis with shami somewhere in there. I hope this NZ team will dominate tests the way Waugh’s Australia or Smith’s SA did. They certainly have the brains and talent to do this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sincere request to BCCI: when NZ tours India next please prepare good pitches for the matches and not go for pointless ‘revenge tactics’. Nobody wants to see Rohit Sharma bat for days in dustbowls. It doesn’t need to be seaming pitches like these just something for bowlers other than Ashwin would be nice.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is an absolutely monumental result. Never thought (until recently!) we would be in a position to even compete for the top spot in test cricket. ODIs and 20/20 yes, but never tests. Just unreal.\n",
      "- New Zealand made things happen on the last day, was looking like a tame draw. Truly deserve the victory.\n",

      "\n",
      "We would love to play more tests against Eng/India/Aus and 5 tests series but the reality is that none of them want to. We have always been told that tests with NZ dont make them enough money and that they dont want to do 5 match series with us. It takes 9 years or whatever for us to even be able to have a series with Aus who are our next door neighbours so for me, you cant have it both ways.\n",

This win would've bought a smile to their faces for sure!\n",

      "They've been a great team over the last few years - the definition of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. They've got a great bowling department, strong batting and a proper team ethos.  Today underlined why they are a good team, the game could have peetered out into a draw, but they bowled well this morning and then hung in there with the bat against some tricky bowling and got over the line with a few overs left. An 8 wicket win looks like a comfortable victory but it was much tighter in reality. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was a bit cynical about the concept of the WTC when it was first mooted  - I thought that a team might just get lucky and win a few matches and sneak through to the final without really deserving it.

      "- BJ still ready for a bat. Legend.\n",
      "- Thoroughly deserved victory for the Kiwis. Even though it was a different format, says a lot about their mental fortitude and self belief to pull themselves up and win after some heartbreaking defeats. Some of their players did talk about being disheartened and their victory today has an important lesson, which is that recovery from a position of despair is often not instantaneous but a process that needs to be respected. Despite not having the hype of some other teams, over the last two years, all players from this team have stuck to their guns and contributed here and there for the results. Well done!\n",

      "NZ has had a litany of journeymen cricketers over the years I’ve been around. It’s so good this team. So much talent.

      "- Extremely happy to see NZ win this title. A squad full of nice and humble guys.\n",
      "- Despite a lot of issue with the league stage of the WTC (which won't be easily solved), I can  say that as a cricket nut, this right here is the final that matters the most. The 2019 WC final was more dramatic, but this was unmatched in pure cricket quality. I can't get over the fact that everyone wrote a result off, but then NZ took 8 wickets and chased a decent total, all in the reserve day. Win by 8 wickets might not be the barest of margins, but in terms of time it absolutely was - the last hour in a SIX day game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of the teams played really fucking well, I know a lot of Indians fans were disgruntled with their 2nd innings batting, but holy shit, NZ were absolutely relentless and most teams would've folded. In fact, India batted brilliantly in the first innings until a jaffa from Jamieson got Kohli, which for me, was the turning moment. Anyway, can't wait for more WTC finals. I hope we get a SENA nations showdown in the subcontinent to see who's worse at playing spin, lol.\n",

I feel extremely proud of Indian team and the performance, keep your head high guys. And for New Zealand, Kane Williamson and Kyle Jamieson, you won billion hearts. Takes a lot of courage and grit to finally get an ICC trophy after 2015 and 2019. One of the best moment for international test  cricket. Thanks India and New Zealand!\n",
      "- Fizzing, we're number one!\n",
      "- Grats NZ, well deserved\n",
      "- NZ deserve ever bit of this success. The heart ache in 2015 in the world cup final with Brendon McCullum and then the 2019 world cup screw over with England. I’m disappointed, as an India supporter but everyone loses and if I had to pick to lose to anyone, it would have been NZ. If I had those two defeats happen to me, I could not have accepted the defeat with the humility and grace that NZ showed. That’s a champions mentality they show then and they were better in these conditions than India and they’ve come a long way with batting. They were always close to number one in bowling and fielding in my eyes. I’m happy they have some deserved reward for playing so well but also filled with sadness at how Rohit Sharma turned the tide away from us yesterday evening and the team didn’t show backbone to defy NZ.\n",

      "- Awesome job. India bowled really well, but couldn't explain a lot of their shots in the second innings- like the pressure got to them. NZ's bowlers were incredible, esp Wags, Jamieson and Southee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some doubts about NZ qualifying through 'easy-beats', but it's clear that they deserved this, convincingly beating England and then India away from home. Hopefully they can continue this great run, inspire some kids to pick up a bat and find adequate replacements for Watling and Taylor- who is sure soon to retire.\n",

      "\n",
      "What makes this loss a bit easier to take is what it means for NZ and people like Ross, BJ and everyone else before them who charted this path for them. Under Kane, they’ll always be a team hard to beat. Amazing grit and determination.\n",

      "It's probably hard for other countries to understand, for almost my entire life NZ has been either middling, or poor at Cricket. We had small dashes of glory, but we'd always lose and losing two WC finals in a row, the second one when it was only an umpiring mistake that even put us in a position to lose, just felt absolutely cruel- like at any moment NZ could go back to being bad again and we might never win at all.\n",

It then retrieves the top 10 posts from the specified subreddit, inserts the post titles, URLs, and scores into the Posts table, while it concurrently fetches comments associated with every single post and saves them to the Comments table. It commits the changes to the database and closes the connection, finally confirming that data has been saved."

    "Begin by installing the necessary library, PRAW, along with the pandas library to handle data, and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. Next, you'll define a Credentials class to hold your Reddit API credentials and create an instance of the Reddit class to fetch posts from subreddits. You will then connect to an SQLite database and create two tables for posts and comments. Then, for an subreddit name specified by you, fetch its posts and scrape their titles, URLs, scores, and comments. Save data to the database. Then, immediately load the data from the database into pandas DataFrames to perform basic exploratory data analysis-EDA: computing summary statistics, and later visualize using matplotlib/seaborn with histograms and scatter plots that investigate relationships in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "This histogram plots the distribution of post scores, considering the pattern in which scores fall within different intervals. The KDE line shows the regions of higher probability density, thus showing where scores cluster. In brief, this graph shows the central tendency and variability of the post scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scatter Plot \n",
    "This scatter plot represents the post-score relationship versus comments. In this scatter plot, one can see precisely how increased scores relate to comment counts from post to post. By making sense of these patterns and trends in engagement with respect to the performance of posts, better insights are derived."
